A package manager

It can download, install, update and remove packages. You can easiely create your own package and mirror, just look at 
the syntax of a PKGINFO.

The packages can be found at http://stones.ddns.net/mirror/main/bin/x86/ .

The code is a bit messy, thats because the project is in a very early stage of development, but it already works fine.
